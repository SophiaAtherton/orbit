# Orbit Project Overview

## What is Orbit?

Orbit is a thoughtfully designed platform aimed at supporting young Aucklanders—especially newcomers to the city—as they navigate the challenges of building social and professional connections. Unlike typical event or networking platforms that assume social confidence and prior knowledge, Orbit focuses on creating a safe, intentional, and low-pressure space for users who may feel anxious, lonely, or unfamiliar with their new environment.

## What problem does it solve?

Many young people arriving in Auckland struggle with social anxiety, loneliness, and uncertainty about how to engage with the community. Existing platforms often overlook these emotional barriers and focus solely on event access. Orbit addresses this gap by focusing on emotional ease and onboarding users not just into events but into the city itself, making the first steps feel manageable and welcoming.

## Key Features and User Flows

- **Dual feed tabs** ("Explore" and "Your Path") to separate discovery from personalized guidance
- **Search bar with filtering options** for easy event exploration
- **Curated event cards** organized by categories like Trending, Coming Up Soon, and Monthly Moments
- **Personalized "Your Path" section** that helps users identify actionable next steps and goals
- **Responsive and accessible design** prioritizing emotional comfort and clarity
- **Soft, approachable language** and interface choices that reduce user anxiety

## Known Issues or Limitations

- Event data is currently hardcoded and would benefit from a dynamic backend integration
